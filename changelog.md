# v2.0.0

## Build 3

- All new triple column support using Apple's own UI Framework. This is much more reliable that my own implementation from v1. 

- An all new Sidebar Interface. This uses Apple's latest UI Framework for displaying your folders and feeds. 

- Unread counts update more reliabily as you read through your content. 

- Improved underlying code for managing the initial state of the app. 

### Known Issues & Other Notes

- Custom theme settings may not apply to the new Sidebar VC. Custom theming will be removed in a future update. 

- No changes to the Articles List or Article Renderer in this update.
