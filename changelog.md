# v2.0.2

## Build 35

- Wordpress blogs convert emojis to an image with the emoji as the alt text on the image. Elytra will now skip rendering the image and appropriately render the emoji used by the author in the same context as the original blog post. This prevents the paragraph breaking on to the next line to accomodate the custom emoji image Wordpress inserts.  

- Minor fixes to regressions introduced in build 34.

## Build 34

- Adds a new, simpler flow for starting the Free Trial. 

- Fixed an issue where the App would show a "No Subscription Found" error after resetting or deactivating your account. 

- Fixed an issue where an interrupted on-boarding would prevent you from using the app without purchasing a subscription. This now ensures you are always able to start your free trial if your onboarding was interrupted. 

- If you're currently enrolled in the Free Trial, the subscriptions interface will now correctly indicate that. 

# Build 32

- Fixes a rotation bug on iPads. 

- Fixes a article scaling bug on iPads when toggling the sidebar. 

- Changing the selected tint color now applies correctly throughout the app. 

- Fixed the app not loading the selected tint color on launch. 

- Fixed an issue when searching for a feed by title or keywords would dismiss the modal. 

- Fixed an issue with pagination when searching for feeds in the Add New Feed interface. 

# v2.0.1

# Build 31

- Fixed applying selected tint colors globally. 

- Deleting a feed (which is inside a folder) no longer collapses the folder. 

- Fixes a crash on opening the Notifications Interface if you have 0 subscriptions.
