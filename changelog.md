# v1.5.0

## Build 278

- **NEW** Image Viewer: Tap on an image in an article to open it in a full screen image viewer. All images from the article are gathered in single place for easier viewing. 

- Fixed a crash that would occur when launching the app. This was a regression introduced in Build 275 of Elytra and OS 13.1.2.

## Build 275

- Sign in With Apple. If you're new to Elytra, you don't need to take any additional steps. If you are new to Elytra, please head over to Settings > Account and link your account from there. 

- Micro.blog posts with images now show the image as a thumbnail in the articles list when settings are enabled for it. 

- Added a new Bookmarks Manager. This is much more efficient system compared to the previous system and is much more scalable.

- Fixed the colour of the summary label (iOS 13 only, correct on iOS 12).
