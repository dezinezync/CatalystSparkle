# v2.1.0

## Build 51

- The article viewer will now draw horizontal rules. 

- The app now saves restoration data properly so launching the app from a saved state is now faster.

- Fixes an issue where images in the article viewer would fail to load (network issues, invalid URL or for whatever other reason) and would show a large placeholder image. 

## Build 50

- During first launch, if your account already has a subscription, the trial interface is no longer shown. You are directly taken to the app. 

- Twitter apps selection now works again when tapping tweets.

- Matched the keyboard navigation to the macOS App. 

## Build 49

- Added support for dragging and dropping articles into the Unread or Bookmark rows in the Sidebar to perform respective actions. 

- Added support for dragging feeds to external applications. This action will drag with the RSS Feed URL.

## Build 47

- Updated images for GIF loading and playback controls.

- Tapping a gallery image now opens it in full view.

- Images in Widgets should now load reliably. I've discarded the older method of loading images in favour of a more standard approach as recommended by Apple Engineering. 

## Build 45

### Fixes

- Fixed the app using a semi-bold font for headings on iOS 14.0.1 and higher. 

- Image Loading options now correctly apply to favicons inside the Articles List Interface. 

- Title Font preference now correctly applies to headings inside the article as well.
