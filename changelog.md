# v1.5.1

## Build 304

- Fix: The sorting option is now loaded correctly when opening a Feed for the first time. Previously, it would load with the default sorting behavior and then upon changing the preference, it would load according to that.

- Fix: Feed not reloading after changing the Sorting option when viewing the Author, Folder or Unread Feeds. 

- Improve: Share extension dismisses itself before opening the app to add a new Feed.
