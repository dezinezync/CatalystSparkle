# v2.1.0

## Build 47

- Updated images for GIF loading and playback controls.

- Tapping a gallery image now opens it in full view.

- Images in Widgets should now load reliably. I've discarded the older method of loading images in favour of a more standard approach as recommended by Apple Engineering. 

## Build 45

### Fixes

- Fixed the app using a semi-bold font for headings on iOS 14.0.1 and higher. 

- Image Loading options now correctly apply to favicons inside the Articles List Interface. 

- Title Font preference now correctly applies to headings inside the article as well.
