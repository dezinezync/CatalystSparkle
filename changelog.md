# v1.5.0

## Build 273

- Micro.blog posts with images now show the image as a thumbnail in the articles list when settings are enabled for it. 

- Added a new Bookmarks Manager. This is much more efficient system compared to the previous system and is much more scalable.

- Fixed the colour of the summary label (iOS 13 only, correct on iOS 12).
