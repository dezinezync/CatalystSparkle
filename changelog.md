## Build 356

### New

- Background Refresh now uses Apple's new API released in iOS 13.  

- A new controller which shows your Articles. You can now search for articles which have been loaded locally and on the server as well. The server option will only match titles,  keywords and author names whereas the local version will only match the author and article's title. 

- The recommendations view is now shown inline. 

- A new horizontal two finger swipe gesture for iPadOS to show and hide the Feeds Interface. This works globally.  

### Fixes

- Fixes some leaks caused when loading images over the network.
