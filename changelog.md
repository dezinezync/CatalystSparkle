# v2.1.3

## Build 72

- Fixed an issue where if an Image provides multiple options, sometimes an invalid URL would be selected and therefore the image would not load at all. 

- Fixed an issue where if you've selected the "Unread" sorting option or are in the unreads feed and refresh the timeline, an incorrect article would be selected. 

- Improved the performance of "Force Re-Sync".
