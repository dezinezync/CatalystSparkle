            <h3>Beta Testers</h3>
            <p>
                I'd like to start the attributions section by thanking all the wonderful beta testers who have supported me with their kind words, time and feeback throughout the process of developing Elytra and keeping my spirits high.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Mercury - Postlight</h3>
            <p>
                The Mercury project by Postlight has been a huge game-changer, which now powers parts of Elytra, like many other wonderful apps like itself.</p>
