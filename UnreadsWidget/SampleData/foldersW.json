While making lists can be helpful, todo lists have one major shortcoming – they don’t show you when you’re going to complete the task. Which is a problem, because everything that you need to do must be accomplished within the context of time. The time blocked schedule essentially takes the things you have to get done from your todo list and slot them onto your calendar, effectively solving this problem and helping you make the most of the 24 hours in your day.","node":"paragraph","url":null,"level":0,"ranges":[]},{"content":"Ian’s Awesome Counter »","node":"header","url":null,"level":3,"ranges":[{"element":"anchor","url":"https:\/\/thesweetsetup.com\/ians-awesome-counter\/","range":"{0, 23}"}]},{"node":"a","level":0,"url":"https:\/\/thesweetsetup.com\/ians-awesome-counter\/","items":[{"node":"image","level":0,"url":"https:\/\/thesweetsetup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iancounter.jpg","attributes":{"alt":"Ian’s Awesome Counter"}}]},{"content":"David Smith (of Widgetsmith fame) just publicly released a great mindfulness app with an incredible backstory.
