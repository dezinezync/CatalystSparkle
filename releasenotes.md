The Winter 2020 build is finally ready in 2021! This is the first release of Elytra which brings local sync, local notifications and a lot of performance and stability improvements to the apps. 

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a review on the App Store. It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.  

## New 

- Local Sync. All feeds are now synced to your device locally, so you can continue reading even when your device is offline. 

- Add a new "Title View" to individual feeds. Open a feed and tap on its title. This shows the Feed Info and two preferences at the moment: Push/Local Notifications & Safari Reader Mode. These are per feed settings. 

- Push Notifications Request Form. If you already have push notifications enabled, you won't see this. This is per device. 

- Added support for background push notifications to keep all your devices in sync without needing manual refreshing. 

- Push Notifications for new articles now download and cache the article for immediate use.  

- Added the "Contact Support" menu item under Help. 

## Improvements

- Tapping on a folder now opens the folder's feed. 

- Tapping on the disclosure icon on a folder now toggles its expanded state. 

- Filtering is now stricter. It'll match "sponsor" but will not match "sponsored". 

- Added Feeds to the iOS Search Index. You can now directly open feeds by their names (or custom names if you have one set).

- Added Force-Resync menu option for macOS. Hold option key before clicking on the Elytra Menu item in the menu bar. 

## Fixes 

- Fixed the tint colour for the blog name when opening a micro-blog article. 

- Fixed adding feed by URL where the feed presents multiple options.

- Fixed an issue when searching by title for 3-letter sites like CNN or BBC. 

- Fixed articles not loading for certain feeds. 

- Fixed Today View not updating when opened after an app launch. 

- Fixed an issue with the iPadOS app showing different widths for the columns in different orientations or environments (split view).

- Fixed an issue with the apps not correctly download bookmarks from the API. 

- Fixed an issue where toggling folders in the sidebar interface would show empty folders. 

- Fixed an issue with certain CJK paragraph blocks rendering incorrectly when certain linebreak characters are used in the paragraph text.  

- Fixed an issue with filters incorrectly hiding articles when matching against CJK based filters. 

- Fixed an issue with line-heights in the articles list for multi-lined article titles with favicons. 

- Fixed an issue where the "no articles" label would appear over the articles. 

- Fixed an issue for adding Streaming Video Channel feeds. They recently changed their format which was causing issues. 

- Fixed a crash when writing the widgets data to disk when the app has just been sent to the background. 

- Fixed Navigation Bar buttons not appearing in some contexts. 

- Fixed the activity indicator not being visible when opening a feed. 

- Fixed an issue where if your account had an expired subscription, it would multiple windows for the Subscriptions interface and eventually fill up the screen.

- Fixed a long standing issue where the article's list would not draw a separator between two articles. 

Thank you for reading.
