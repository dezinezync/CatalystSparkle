[NEW]
- Mark All Read button is now split into two actions:
    1. Mark All Articles which are currently loaded as read.
    2. Mark All Articles including back dated ones as read. (Default)

- New Article Preview Layout (more on this later.)

- Renaming Feeds. Long tap on a feed to bring up the rename option.

- Youtube videos are now rendered natively within the app when possible. This removes the last piece dependant on webviews. 

[IMPROVE]
- Reduced memory usage on boot.
- Reduced memory usage when showing cover images.
- Fixed jumpy scroll views when loading additional content.
- Reduced power usage when syncing new Feeds & Unread items information.
- When opening links inside Safari within the app, the Safari view is now tinted as per your preference.

Build 189 included the following note:
"Experimental code to improve memory management for articles with a lot of images. Please let me know if you notice any issues when scrolling inside an article when the image begins to go off-screen."

This is now permanent and active for all users.

[FIX]
- Fixed a bug with Bookmarks sometimes not loading correctly for some users.
