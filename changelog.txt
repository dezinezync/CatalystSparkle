[FIXES]
- Fixed a crash when loading some specific articles which could cause the app to continously build up RAM usage and eventually crash.

[IMPROVE]
- Experimental code to improve memory management for articles with a lot of images. Please let me know if you notice any issues when scrolling inside an article when the image begins to go off-screen.
