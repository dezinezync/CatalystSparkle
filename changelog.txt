Version 1.1.0 Update Notes

[NEW]
- Image and Video enclosures are now displayed in the Article when available. These are attachments published by blogs and websites as separate attachments. These aren't included in Post's body so they were never surfaced until now. Image enclosures do not come with captions so captions are skipped for such images. Audio enclosures are not supported at the moment.
- Extended layout on iPads. The new layout uses the right (left for RTL languages) section on iPads to display articles.

[IMPROVE]
- Completes implementation of OPML interfaces.

[IMPROVE]
- Elytra's Action Extension is now much much faster. It interacts directly with a webpage if one is available to find the RSS Feeds advertisted by that web page.
- Improved Voice Over text for Settings, Recommendations, New Folder and New Feed buttons on the Feeds Interface.
- OPML view improvements. This is still Work-In-Progress.

[FIX]
- Renaming a Folder is now an instant action and no longer requires a refresh.
- Deleting a renamed folder no longer crashes the app.
- Changing the theme followed by opening an article and then tapping on search now correctly presents the search bar and associated buttons. Previously, the search bar did not appear at all showing just the keyboard.
- The Appearance Interface now uses the current Accent colour when tapping on cells.
- Fixes glitches for folder updates including deletion.
- Fixes folder move bug using drag and drop on iPads.
