[NEW]
- The Black theme is now supported on additional OLED Display based devices.

[IMPROVE]
- Split View behaves better on phones which support the mode in landscape orientation.
- Unread counts should now behave more consistently. 

[FIX]
- Quotes and citations used to get clipped when rotating the device. This no longer occurs.
- Feeds with no recent articles now show an appropriate message. The loading indicator should no longer be spinning into perpetuity.

[NOTE]
- The close button has been temporarily removed from Wider layouts until I can come up with a better experience to replace it or improve it.
