[NEW]
- As and when the OS determines, images in galleries will now be prefetched so they are ready when you're about to view them (exception: doesn't work very well for large images or slow connections) #GH-28

[IMPROVEMENTS]
- The Share Extension will now dismiss itself once it has completed it's work.
- The Navigation Bar for the Share Extension now extends all the way to the top edge.
- Paragraphs that are drawn lazily on screen now have the correct attributes that Voice Over can recognize them instantly.
- Improved text for Voice Over for feeds and folders on the main interface.
- Improved text for Voice Over for article lists. The old behavior where the Voice Over engine said "2d" instead of "2 days" is also changed in this build.
- Headings no longer call out the level when Voice Over reads it. It will now only read the content.
- When you purchase a subscription (non-testable directly in Test Flight builds), the receipt is immediately verified and the status is updated. #GH-19

[FIXES]
- Scrollbars now use the correct dark or light tinting based on your active theme. GH-24
- Fixes a crash that would occur when the App tried to load an article with an invalid ID.
- Rotating the device no longer causes Voice Over to stop recognizing on-screen elements.
- Prevents the app from crashing when it's restoring it's state back to an article.
- Mark All Unread (including articles not currently loaded in the app) from the Unread Interface now works as expected. #GH-18-TF
- Code formatting in Headers now uses the same font size as the heading itself.
- Fixed a bunch of memory leaks that would occur when the app launches.
