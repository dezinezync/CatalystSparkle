[IMPROVE]
- the new Add Feed Interface will now respect the readable width on iPads when applicable.

[FIX]
- In the new Add Feed Interface, if you had a query in the search bar (with Title or Keyword selected) and then tapped on the URL scope, the app would run a search with that as the url. This will no longer happen.
- fixes the jerky scroll animation when showing cover images
- fixes a rare crash when opening the Unread Feed.

[IMPROVE]
- Improved height calculation of new article cells when showing summaries when available.
- Improved spacing of the timestamp on article cells in the absence of a cover image
- The two finger swipe up or down gesture will now cycle through the available themes.
- Improved memory management. The app on startup now consumes 5% less RAM. This also improves restoration times when waking the app from the background.

[FIX]
- The app will no longer try to open an article when receiving a push notification for a batch of articles.

This build also introduces certain logic that will enable syncing of preferences across devices easily including other platforms. More on that soon.

- Mark All Read button is now split into two actions:
    1. Mark All Articles which are currently loaded as read.

- New Article Preview Layout (more on this later.)

- Renaming Feeds. Long tap on a feed to bring up the rename option.

"Experimental code to improve memory management for articles with a lot of images. Please let me know if you notice any issues when scrolling inside an article when the image begins to go off-screen."

This is now permanent and active for all users.
